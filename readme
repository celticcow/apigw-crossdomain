build out an api gw to do crossdomain search based on

{ "ipaddr" : "aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd" }

phase 1:
get list of cma's

phase 2: 
search domains and append where used to results.

curl http://localhost:5000/crossdomain -X POST --data '{"ipaddr" : "146.18.2.137"}'

issue log:
* phase 2 is good, but when we have rules returned via where-used we have uid only
   crossdomain search prev used a def rule_output(access_rule_result): to extract the rule in human format
   will need to do something similar and construct json out for this and append
